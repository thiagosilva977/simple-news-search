The African nation has been roiled by a 16-month conflict and devastating floods. Health Minister Haitham Mohamed Ibrahim said in a statement that at least 22 people have died from the disease, and that at least 354 confirmed cases of cholera have been detected across the county. Ibrahim didn\u2019t give a time frame for the deaths or the tally since the start of the year. The World Health Organization, however, said that 78 deaths were recorded from cholera this year in Sudan as of July 28. The disease also sickened more than 2,400 others between Jan. 1 and July 28, it said. Cholera is a fast-developing, highly contagious infection that causes diarrhea, leading to severe dehydration and possible death within hours when not treated, according to WHO. It is transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. The cholera outbreak is the latest calamity for Sudan, which was plunged into chaos in April last year when simmering tensions between the military and a powerful paramilitary group exploded into open warfare across the country. The conflict has turned the capital, Khartoum and other urban areas into battlefields, wrecking civilian infrastructure and an already battered health care system. Without the basics, many hospitals and medical facilities have closed their doors. It has killed thousands of people and pushed many into starvation, with famine already confirmed in a sprawling camp for displaced people in the wrecked northern region of Darfur. Sudan\u2019s conflict has created the world\u2019s largest displacement crisis. More than 10.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes since fighting began, according to the International Organization for Migration. Over 2 million of those fled to neighboring countries. The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the U.N. and international rights groups. Devastating seasonal floods in recent weeks have compounded the misery. Dozens of people have been killed and critical infrastructure has been washed away in 12 of Sudan\u2019s 18 provinces, according to local authorities. About 118,000 people have been displaced due to the floods, according to the U.N. migration agency. Cholera is not uncommon in Sudan. A previous major outbreak left at least 700 dead and sickened about 22,000 in less than two months in 2017. Tarik Ja\u0161arevi\u0107, a spokesman for WHO, said the outbreak began in the eastern province of Kassala before spreading to nine localities in five provinces. He said in comments to The Associated Press that data showed that most of the detected cases were not vaccinated. He said the WHO is now working with the Sudanese health authorities and partners to implement a vaccination campaign. Sudan\u2019s military-controlled sovereign council, meanwhile, said Sunday it will send a government delegation to meet with American officials in Cairo amid mounting U.S. pressure on the military to join ongoing peace talks in Switzerland that aim at finding a way out of the conflict. The council said in a statement the Cairo meeting will focus on the implementation of a deal between the military and the Rapid Support Forces, which required the paramilitary group to pull out from people\u2019s homes in Khartoum and elsewhere in the country. The talks began Aug. 14 in Switzerland with diplomats from the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, the African Union and the United Nations attending. A delegation from the RSF was in Geneva but didn\u2019t join the meetings.', 'date': None, 'picture_url': 'https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/94c503b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x236+0+0/resize/320x118!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fc3%2F4c%2F65482a7b452db66043542c093eaf%2Fpromo-2x.png', 'picture_caption': None, 'authors': 'By SAMY MAGDY', 'contains_monetary': False, 'picture_path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\thiag\\\\vscode_projects\\\\news-crawler\\\\simple-news-search-engine\\\\news_data_extractor\\\\source\\\\downloaded_images\\\\90.png', 'embedding': array([ 1.50528312e-01, -1.55666679e-01, -7.84077570e-02,  6.91189915e-02,\n        1.64878935e-01,  8.60281587e-02,  2.84263492e-01,  1.15083292e-01,\n        1.45102441e-01,  2.35795543e-01, -5.16362526e-02,  6.88907132e-03,\n       -3.98942292e-01, -4.77667451e-02, -9.16666314e-02, -1.16857767e-01,\n       -1.34669885e-01,  2.85980850e-01, -1.88948121e-02,  5.20776808e-02,\n       -2.33317450e-01,  6.49276450e-02,  2.53423993e-02, -3.15877050e-01,\n        4.44753133e-02, -1.48694247e-01,  4.60097075e-01,  1.81665793e-01,\n        2.46981293e-01,  1.30669072e-01,  7.90181756e-03, -1.53879106e-01,\n        2.54336864e-01, -9.43385288e-02, -1.27961636e-01, -8.56527165e-02,\n        3.54946740e-02,  1.41570956e-01, -9.01295841e-02,  6.84203729e-02,\n       -1.51995987e-01,  1.76039428e-01, -2.30676547e-01, -2.76999902e-02,\n        2.38211945e-01,  1.96613476e-01, -5.01775593e-02,  1.60168499e-01,\n        2.01299548e-01, -1.82852503e-02, -3.51955831e-01, -5.83268665e-02,\n        1.14950798e-01, -2.24618599e-01, -1.73878238e-01,  1.32446945e-01,\n       -5.81515357e-02, -1.44958943e-01,  1.64693773e-01, -1.49720833e-01,\n       -4.80545089e-02, -5.32926261e-01,  6.28048694e-03,  1.53337205e-02,\n        9.84924436e-02, -1.12871043e-01,  1.37759522e-01, -1.56778857e-01,\n        1.39695853e-01,  2.37054050e-01,  1.70230284e-01,  1.44943476e-01,\n        1.37686394e-02, -1.59393057e-01, -2.30026096e-01, -3.02444428e-01,\n       -2.43792802e-01, -3.34400058e-01, -7.56115243e-02, -2.42729634e-01,\n       -1.27677396e-01,  3.35226730e-02, -1.10502660e-01, -1.25288844e-01,\n        1.33371614e-02,  5.46412617e-02,  1.41719729e-01,  1.60323605e-01,\n       -3.22522074e-01,  2.84917533e-01, -6.27059862e-02,  1.44774996e-04,\n        4.65994000e-01,  3.83850843e-01, -1.05654068e-01,  4.74910848e-02],\n      dtype=float32)}, {'url': 'https://gothamist.com//arts-entertainment/meet-some-of-the-new-yorkers-who-are-competing-in-the-paris-olympics', 'source': 'gothamist', 'title': 'Meet some of the New Yorkers who are competing in the Paris Olympics', 'description': 'On July 26, athletes from across the globe will participate in the opening ceremony for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France.

One major change could have long-lasting positive ramifications for the City of Angels, and Mayor Karen Bass detailed the ambitious plan in a statement. \"We\\'re already working to create jobs by expanding our public transportation system in order for us to have a no car games,\" Bass said in a press conference, per Reuters. \"And that\\'s a feat in Los Angeles, because we\\'ve always been in love with our cars, but we\\'re already working to ensure that we can build a greener Los Angeles.\" \"The no car Games means that you will have to take public transportation to get to all of the venues,\" Bass added, per the news service. It\\'s a welcome announcement for a city typically known for its large car volumes and regular traffic jams. The Paris Games showed that having major venues linked by public transport is possible, but that was mostly thanks to an extensive and heavily used subway network, something that is smaller and not so developed in LA, as the Time Out Los Angeles website pointed out. Los Angeles once had a trolley system that connected the city, but pressure from the automobile industry hastened its decline, and it was put out of commission in 1963, according to the Southern California Railway Museum. Today, the city has a public transit system that includes subways, buses, light rail, and shuttles. Still, the love affair with dirty fuel-powered cars has also made the city notorious for being the supposed birthplace of the modern freeway system, as Reuters observed. But the arrival of the games could make Los Angeles a world leader in public transport connections again. For a state known for a number of green credentials \u2014 such as boasting the highest number of electric car registrations in the United States according to the U.S. Department of Energy \u2014 it appears the project would welcome support from residents. In addition to improvements to local rail and bus systems, Bass said the city will loan 3,000 buses to help ease traffic congestion. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, \"the largest sources of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions include passenger cars, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and light-duty trucks, including sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and minivans.\" With that in mind, reducing the number of these vehicles on the roads will help cut the production of planet-warming gas pollution from the tailpipes of these machines, which also contribute to poor air quality and increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. As the global spotlight will be on LA in 2028, it will want to set a good example for how cleaner, greener urban transportation can be achieved in a relatively short timescale, thanks to careful planning and preparation. Residents of the city, the state, and the United States as a whole should feel the benefit for years to come.

In a Sydney warehouse-turned-community centre, breakers warm up with ab exercises that would make a Pilates teacher cry, before taking to the floor with acrobatic moves so intricate you can barely make them out. It is one of the most important events of the year \u2013 a qualifier for the Red Bull BC One World Finals \u2013 and the past week weighs heavy. A few people nervously glance at the handful of cameras lining the dance circle, their minds no doubt flashing to images of Gunn which have set the internet alight. \u201cI feel like it\\'s just pushed our scene in Australia into the Dark Ages,\u201d Australian hip-hop pioneer Spice told the BBC. Gunn, a 36-year-old university lecturer, lost all three of her Olympic battles in viral fashion, her green tracksuit and unorthodox routine \u2013 which included the sprinkler and kangaroo-inspired hopping \u2013 generating waves of memes and abuse. The fallout has divided and disappointed the Australian breaking community. \u201cIt made a mockery of the Australian scene and I think that\\'s why a lot of us are hurting,\u201d Spice says. Many have rushed to defend Raygun against the onslaught. Others are ready to admit there are questions to be answered over her qualification and performance, but say the global bullying has undermined any attempt to fairly analyse what went down in Paris. Gunn was always a dancer - albeit in jazz, tap and ballroom first - but it was her husband and coach Samuel Free that introduced her to the world of breaking when she was 20. She says it took years to find her place in the male-dominated scene. \u201cThere were times that I would go into the bathroom crying because I was so embarrassed at how terrible I was at this,\u201d she told The Guardian Australia ahead of the Olympics. Eventually though, Gunn became the face of breaking in Australia \u2013 a top-ranked B-girl and an academic with a PhD in the cultural politics of the sport. And at an Olympics qualifying event in Sydney last October, where 15 women from across Oceania competed, Raygun emerged triumphant and booked her ticket to Paris. Like Gunn, breaking was perhaps a surprising candidate for the Olympics. Born in the cultural melting pot of the Bronx in the 1970s, the street dance quickly became a global phenomenon. And in recent years it caught the eye of Olympics chiefs desperate to attract new and younger audiences. Some argued it didn\u2019t deserve Olympic attention, while others insisted a competition like that could not capture breaking\u2019s essence and would only further divorce the artform from the street culture it came from. All eyes were on the event in Paris to see if the Olympic Committee\u2019s gamble would pay off. From the moment the final B-girl battle at the Olympics wrapped up, it was clear that breaking had indeed captured global attention \u2013 or, more specifically, Raygun had. Rumours and criticism of her performance spread like wildfire, particularly online. Gunn received a torrent of violent messages, and an anonymous petition demanding she apologise was signed by 50,000 people. She was accused - without evidence - of manipulating her way onto the world\u2019s biggest stage at the expense of other talent in the Australian hip-hop scene. Some people shared a conspiracy that she had created the governing body which ran the Oceania qualifiers, and a lie that her husband - who is also a prominent breaker and a qualified judge - was on the panel that selected her. Australian factchecking organisations and AUSBreaking, the national organisation for breaking, quickly tried to correct the record, but that didn\u2019t stop the flood. Then there were those arguing that she had mocked and appropriated hip-hop culture. \"It just looked like somebody who was toying with the culture and didn\\'t know how culturally significant it was,\u201d Malik Dixon told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In a series of statements, AUSBreaking stressed that judges were \u201ctrained to uphold the highest standards of impartiality\u201d and that not a single person on the nine-person panel for the Oceania qualifiers was Australian. And while AUSBreaking has had many \u201cinteractions\u201d with Raygun since its conception in 2019, at no point has she ever held a leadership position or been involved in \u201cany decision making over events, funding, strategy, judge selection or athlete selection\u201d. Taking to Instagram to rubbish all the \u201ccrackpot theories\u201d, Te Hiiritanga Wepiha - a Kiwi judge on the Oceania qualifying panel - said Raygun won fair and square. \u201cAll us judges talked about how she was going to get smashed, absolutely smashed [at the Olympics]\u2026 She knew it was going to be rough, so it\\'s actually courageous of her,\" Wepiha \u2013 also known as Rush \u2013 said in a livestream Some of the country\u2019s most decorated athletes and highest Olympic officials also loudly defended Gunn. \"The petition has stirred up public hatred without any factual basis. It\\'s appalling,\" the Australian Olympic Committee\u2019s Matt Carroll said. Gunn herself had previously said she was \u201cnever\u201d going to be able to beat her powerful competitors, so had \u201cwanted to move differently, be artistic and creative\u201d. In a video posted to social media in the eye of the public storm, Gunn added that she had taken the competition \u201cvery seriously\u201d. \u201cI worked my butt off preparing for the Olympics and I gave my all. Truly.\u201d She had only been trying to \u201cbring some joy\u201d, she said. \"I didn\\'t realize that that would also open the door to so much hate, which has frankly been pretty devastating.\u201d Some within the Australian hip-hop community admit the response to Raygun\u2019s routine initially elicited \u201ca chuckle\u201d - but it quickly got out of hand. Everyone was unequivocal in condemning the sheer volume of abuse, ridicule and misinformation that has targeted Raygun and the broader Australian B-girl community. But beyond that, the feeling is somewhat split. Many B-girls say Raygun\u2019s performance does not reflect the standard in Australia. \u201cWhen I first saw it, I was so embarrassed,\u201d Spice \u2013 who retired from breaking years ago \u2013 says. On any other stage, Raygun would have been encouraged and supported for \u201chaving a go\u201d, Spice says, but people representing the country need to be at a certain level. \u201cIt\u2019s the Olympics for God\\'s sake! \u201cIn hip-hop we have this thing, you step up or you step off\u2026 You need to know your place.\u201d She stresses, though, that the \u201cbullying is just disgusting\u201d - and many like herself have been reluctant to speak up out of fear of adding to Gunn\\'s anguish. But the impact of the controversy on local Australian B-girls has also been \"devastating\", Tinylocks told the BBC. Like some others the BBC spoke to, she did not want her full name published because of the scale of abuse that is circulating. B-girl\u2019s videos are being trolled, their DMs inundated with insults and violent threats. Young dancers are being harassed at school, and many now feel unsafe practising in public. \"Telling us to be positive and supportive while we are being harmed is unacceptable... [we\u2019re] allowed to be angry,\u201d she said in a statement. Tinylocks \u2013 who herself has battled Raygun \u2013 thinks Gunn simply had a terrible day, but says there are questions about her preparation and routine that need answering. \u201cWe know you\\'re capable of more\u2026 Were you set up for success?\u201d According to Wepiha, Gunn\\'s victory in qualifying reflects the size of the \u201ctiny\u201d breaking scene in Australia, and the even tinier public and government support for it. \"I mean, we had to actually get people out of retirement to make up the numbers,\" he said. \"That\\'s how small the scene is.\" Others says there were rules which may have made a small talent pool even shallower \u2013 like the requirement that potential qualifiers be a member of AUSBreaking and that they have a valid passport, in line with rules put forward by the World Dance Sport Federation. AUSBreaking did not respond to the BBC\u2019s queries about Raygun\u2019s selection, the financial support it receives or how it seeks out the country\u2019s best breaking talent. But Steve Gow, the group\u2019s secretary and long-time b-boy Stevie G, tells the BBC the size and isolation of Australia inhibits the growth and development of the scene. Being so distant from other, bigger hip-hop communities abroad can make it hard \u2013 both in terms of time and money \u2013 to learn from them. \u201cIt can be very insular,\u201d he says. As if proving the point, he regularly pauses to greet almost everyone who walks into the Red Bull competition, which he is judging. He insists there is still a high quality of breaking in Australia. Ultimately, the community is bitterly hurt by the world\u2019s response. They feel breaking isn\u2019t truly understood, and that people have piled on without knowledge or context. \u201cIt\u2019s a big disappointment because they\u2019re not talking about the winners\u2026 they\u2019re all talking about Raygun\u2019s memes, and they\u2019re not even seeing her full set,\u201d Samson Smith \u2013 a member of hip-hop group Justice Crew \u2013 told Network 10. But many hope a silver lining may yet emerge. \"She might actually bring enough attention to get resources,\u201d Wepiha said. \u201cAt the end of the day, Australia has the most famous Olympian of 2024 and she might actually save the scene here.\" Long-doubted by Democrats, Kamala Harris faces her biggest political moment Phone taps, sabotage and an assassination plot: Is Germany in Cold War 2.0?
